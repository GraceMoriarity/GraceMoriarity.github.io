<p> 
    HDDs are aluminum or glass disks that are covered in magnetic material.  They hold and store software programs, operating systems, and other files. HDDs also control the reading and writing, whereas the hard disk provides data storage. There are four main components of a hard drive. The first is the platter, which stores the data, then the spindle, which spins the platter, the read/write arm and finally the actuator for controlling the arm. Hard disk drives are usually the primary or secondary storage device in a computer. If an HDD is removed from a computer then it no longer contains your personal data. However the HDD itself could be connected to another computer to access your data.
