    IBM (International Business Machines) is an American multinational technology corporation that was founded in 1911. They manufactured the first ever hard disk drive in 1956. Even though it was the size of a refrigerator, it could only store 5 MB of data. In 1970 they made great advancements in the HDD by making it much smaller and having it hold 30MB instead of the original 5MB. At the moment 20 TB is the largest HDD size available and is produced by Seagate. A TB is a terabyte which is equal to 1024 gigabytes(TB). This HDD comes in the standard 3.5 inch size. A typical HDD now has 500 GB or more of storage.
