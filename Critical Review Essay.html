    <br> Title: Analysis of Chapter 1 - The Truth About Stories
    <br>
    <br>“It’s about the Earth and how it floats in space on the back of a turtle.” King tells us the story of Earth’s origin from the Native perspective. He compares the story of his people to that of the Christian story of Genesis and questions the effect these stories have on the listeners and how they differ. He questions how people’s beliefs and attitudes are formed by stories they hear growing up. King asks whether a positive origin story can result in a more positive society.
The Native origin story tells of a curious woman falling from the sky and landing on Earth when it was covered only in water. The animals placed her on a turtle’s back as she could not swim. The otter  then helped her get mud from which she could create land. She was pregnant with Twins and when they were born they were able to create trees, waterways and mountains. One twin would create everything in an organized and orderly fashion, while the other would change it to a more scattered and chaotic landscape. It’s a positive story about humans and animals working together.
The Christian story from Genesis tells how God created the Earth and put Adam & Eve in the Garden of Eden. He then gave them one rule, to not eat from the apple tree. When they broke this rule, God punished them by kicking them out of the garden and letting evil into the world. This story is of one all powerful entity judging humanity.
<br>
<br> King also wrote about his father and how he left him and his brother when they were young. They thought he was likely dead when in fact he had married twice more and had two other families. King went on to explain how it shaped his childhood moving forward. How his mother had struggled living in a time when it was mostly men in the workforce. No matter how smart his mother was or what she was able to do, she was never paid the same as her male co-workers. In those days women were supposed to be able to stay home but this is not an option with no man in the household. His mother always stayed optimistic that things would change and get better even though it never happened in her lifetime. The stories she was raised hearing were positive. Perhaps this allowed her to believe that things would get better rather than feeling anger about the injustice of her situation.
<br>
<br>Conclusion 
<br>
<br>King doesn’t seem to believe that any of these origin stories are true. He is more so looking at the effects of these stories and the influences they have on communities. Is it human nature to judge others and impart punishment or could this tendency come from the Christian belief in God and judgment day? King seems to be saying that the stories of the Native people create a more accepting attitude towards others and their flaws.
