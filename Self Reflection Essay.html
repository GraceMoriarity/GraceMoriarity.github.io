    <br> Title : Not to be Blunt…
    <br>
        <br> As a student at Acadecap, I have read a series of books on a multitude of different subjects. Though there is something to learn from all types of books, I mostly enjoyed reading books that were fictional rather than based on reality. I face obstacles with my learning challenges but I don’t allow them to limit my education. This year I would like to read books to help me learn more about human behavior to understand my own behavior better. 
           Last year in English we did writing assignments based on the books we read. For example, we read “Lord of the Flies” last year and every 2 chapters we did assignments like character analysis or finding key phrases that foreshadowed what was to come. We focused on learning about the use of literary devices such as onomatopoeia, alliteration,  personification, similes, hyperboles and metaphors, amongst others. I also learnt about how to properly structure an essay and use those literary devices to get my point across. We also spent some time on journalistic writing and debating techniques. This taught me how to convey and defend my own point of view.
            As a dyslexic learner, I have struggled with reading and writing my entire life and still do to this day. It can be difficult for me to get through books so I have learned to appreciate audiobooks. At my previous school, my resources were limited but since coming to Acadecap I have learned about all the tools that I can utilize to my advantage. They allow me to appreciate books and what can be gained from reading. Although I am distracted easily, due to my ADD, I always show determination in my work and will continue to do so throughout this new school year.

         <br>  I typically don’t read books unless they're for school. When I was younger I always struggled with reading and over time I think I've just built up a hatred towards books. It's kind of like a reminder it's something I can't do as well as other people and that always frustrated me on a personal level. The last book I remember reading on my own was a 300 page barbie book in grade five. Considering that the only books I've ever really read are ones that have been assigned to me. Indian horse, Lord of the Flies, House of the Scorpion, A Raisin in the Sun, Beowulf, Refugee and Rise of the Rocket Girls.
           I would like to read or listen to books that create an alternate reality. I’m interested in books that are different from my own life. I feel like my life is normal which can be boring so I would prefer to imagine an alternate universe where exciting things happen. In these worlds, people hijack planes, control the multiverse and witches cast spells. Watching a show or reading a book lets me take a break from my life and imagine a world that is the polar opposite to mine. Don’t get me wrong, I love my life but sometimes it’s good to take a break from your life and just imagine.

    <br>       Conclusion
            Overall, I can see myself possibly enjoying an audio book or two. I will complete all tasks that are assigned to me no matter the difficulty as I am determined to graduate. I appreciate the platform you have given me to express my feelings about the subject of English and I’m looking forward to the school year ahead.
