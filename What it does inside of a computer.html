    Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, referred to as SATA, is a computer bus interface which transfers data from a computerâ€™s central circuit system to its storage devices, such as the hard disk drive. SATA was released in 2000 to replace PATA, Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment. PATA used a 16-bit wide data bus with support and control functions operating at a lower frequency. SATA utilizes a high speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors. Newer technologies, such as NVMe, are replacing SATA in newer computers as they offer even faster performance.

    <br> The HDD looks like a box inside of a metal housing with the label HDD on it. It connects with a little spring mechanism at the bottom and pushes in and out. The HDD is located in one of the drive slots on the front of a computer tower in a desktop PC or mounted under the keyboard in a laptop.
